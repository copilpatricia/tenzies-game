# Tenzies game

## Description

"Tenzies" is a simple yet engaging dice game built using React, designed to provide users with a fun and interactive gaming experience.

Players can click the "Roll" button to roll the dice. Each die displays a random value between 1 and 6.

Players can click on individual dice to "freeze" them at their current value, preventing them from being re-rolled.

The game automatically detects when all dice show the same value using the useEffect hook. Once achieved, players are notified of their victory.

After winning, players can start a new game by clicking the "New game" button, which resets the dice and allows them to play again.

The game includes a visual effect of confetti falling upon winning, enhancing the player's sense of achievement.
